name: init-team
description: Set up the engineering-team agents for this project. Detects the project's stack, test commands, tracker and environments; asks only what it cannot infer; then writes .claude/team/project.md and scaffolds the QA and ops directories. Use after installing the engineering-team plugin, when the agents report that .claude/team/project.md is missing, or when the project's commands, tracker or environments have changed and the profile needs refreshing.

# init-team

The agents in this plugin ship deliberately generic. Everything project-specific — tracker and field names, workflow states, build and test commands, environments, how QA exercises the software — lives in one generated file, `.claude/team/project.md`. Your job is to produce that file, scaffold the directories the agents expect, and verify the install.

**Detect before you ask.** The worst version of this skill is a twenty-question interrogation about things sitting in the repo. Read first, ask only about what you genuinely cannot infer, and show the user what you found so they can correct it.

## 1. Detect

Work out as much as possible from the repo, and note your confidence in each:

- **Project type and stack** — `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `pom.xml`, `*.csproj`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `Gemfile`, `build.gradle`, `*.sln`, Dockerfiles, `Makefile`. Is there a web surface (a dev-server script, a framework dependency, an `index.html`)? An API (route definitions, an OpenAPI spec)? A CLI (a `bin` entry)? A library (an exported package with no entry point)? Migrations (a `migrations/` directory)? A mobile target (`android/`, `ios/`, a `.xcodeproj`)?
- **Verification commands** — the `scripts` block, `Makefile` targets, or the CI workflow files under `.github/workflows` or `azure-pipelines.yml`. **CI config is the most reliable source**: it names the commands that actually have to pass. Prefer the project's own script wrapper over a bare tool invocation, so config and transforms are picked up.
- **Trunk branch and remote** — `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, `git remote -v`. The remote host tells you the likely tracker and PR tool.
- **Branch convention** — `git log --format=%D` or recent branch names; infer the ticket-key pattern if there is one.
- **Existing tracker tooling** — which MCP servers are actually available in this session. **Use the real tool prefix you can see** (e.g. `mcp__atlassian__*`), never a guessed one; a wrong prefix is the single most common cause of an agent silently lacking a tool.
- **Automated PR reviewers** — the highest-value detection here, because the team currently has no way to know about them. Check both:
  - *Config in the repo:* `.coderabbit.yaml`, a Greptile config, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and any workflow under `.github/workflows/` or `azure-pipelines.yml` that invokes a review action (CodeRabbit, Greptile, Codex, `claude-code-action`, Copilot review).
  - *Recent PRs, which is the stronger signal* — a bot installed as a GitHub App leaves no trace in the repo. List a few recently merged PRs and look at who reviewed or commented; authors whose login ends in `[bot]` or which are marked as apps are your answer. Note roughly how long after PR open each one posted, and whether its approval appears as a required check.
- **Existing conventions** — a `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `CONTRIBUTING.md` already in the repo. Harvest it rather than re-asking the user; contradicting an existing CLAUDE.md is worse than being silent.
- **Prior profile** — if `.claude/team/project.md` already exists, read it and treat this as a refresh: confirm what's still true, update what isn't, and don't discard the prose sections a human has written.

## 2. Discover tracker fields rather than asking for IDs

If the project uses a tracker with an MCP server available, look the fields up instead of asking the user to know internal field IDs. For Jira, fetch the create/edit field metadata for the project's issue types and find the fields whose names correspond to acceptance criteria and to validation or QA instructions; record both the human name and the `customfield_NNNNN` ID, because agents need the ID and humans need the name. Note any field the create API demands and the format it wants — that detail is exactly what costs someone an afternoon later.

If no tracker MCP is available, don't fake it. Record `ticket_system: none` and note that agents should skip ticket transitions and report to the lead only.

## 3. Ask only the gaps

Use `AskUserQuestion` for what you couldn't infer, batching related questions. Realistic gaps:

- **How QA should exercise this software**, if the project type is ambiguous or mixed. This is the highest-value question in the whole interview: it determines whether QA drives a browser, probes an API, runs a CLI, writes a consumer harness, or runs migrations against a realistic dataset. Get it wrong and every QA run is theater.
- **Ephemeral/preview environments** — do they exist, how is one created, how is one reset? If the project has a skill or script for this, name it.
- **Workflow state names**, if the tracker exposes several and the mapping isn't obvious.
- **The stream slug** — propose the repo name; it only needs confirming.
- **How many agents may run at once** (`max_parallel_agents`). Each parallel IC or QA run is a git worktree with its own dependency install and test run. Check the machine's memory and how heavy one install-and-test cycle is in this project, and propose a number; 3 is a safe default for a typical project on a 32 GB machine.
- **Prerequisites to run locally** that aren't in the repo: required services, env vars, seed data, credentials. Ask what's needed, never for the secret values themselves.

### Always ask about the merge policy

This one is never inferred. Ask it every time, including on a refresh, and present it plainly — the user is deciding how much autonomy to hand over:

- **`human-approval`** (recommend this, and it's the default if they don't decide) — the team implements, reviews, validates and prepares the merge, then stops and notifies a human, who merges. A hook enforces it: agents are blocked from completing a merge.
- **`autonomous`** — the team merges to the trunk itself once both gates are green. Say out loud what this means: a ticket can go from assignment to merged trunk with no human in the loop at any point.

If they choose `human-approval`, you need two more things:

- **Who approves** — the handle to request PR review from.
- **How to notify them.** Check what's actually available in this session before offering options. A chat MCP (Slack, Teams) if one is present; otherwise a PR review request, which always works and lands in their normal workflow; otherwise reporting in session only. Record the exact tool and channel, not "notify the user" — an agent can't act on that. Prefer *both* a review request and a chat ping when a chat tool exists: the request is durable, the ping is timely.

If they choose `autonomous`, still agree an **escalation list** — the change types that warrant a human even so (auth, permissions, billing, customer data, migrations, public contracts, infrastructure). Start from that list and let them edit it.

### Ask about automated reviewers only to confirm

Show what you detected and confirm it, rather than asking from scratch. A review app installed across a whole account or organization may not have reviewed any PR you sampled — it may skip PRs based on a branch other than the trunk, or above a size limit, or be on a plan that only summarizes — so ask directly whether any review apps are installed beyond the ones you found. For each bot, record its **limits**: which base branches it reviews, size caps, and what its plan does and doesn't do. Without them, a skipped PR looks like a stuck bot. What you can't detect and should ask: how a comment is marked addressed on this repo (reply, resolve the thread, a keyword the tool recognizes), and whether any of them reliably produce **known noise** on this codebase — findings that are always wrong here. That last answer saves the reviewer re-litigating the same false positive on every PR, so it's worth asking even though it feels like an odd question.

When the user corrects a detection, take the correction and don't re-litigate it.

### Knowledge sources

Run the `team-ops:init-knowledge` skill now. It finds every documentation and knowledge source this project can reach — including MCP servers named after the product or an internal system, and connectors that exist but aren't authorized — and every codebase the work builds against or imitates beyond this repository, asks what each is for, and writes the shared `.claude/team/knowledge.md` that every team's agents read. If the file already exists because the other team's setup wrote it, the skill confirms and fills gaps rather than asking again. When it finishes, carry on here.

## 4. Write the profile

Copy `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/team/project.md` to `.claude/team/project.md` and fill it in. Rules:

- **Every placeholder gets replaced or removed.** A profile shipped with `<command>` still in it is worse than no profile — an agent will read it as literal.
- **Commands must be the real, runnable ones.** Verify each by running it if it's safe and fast (`lint`, `typecheck`, `--version`); don't run a full suite or anything destructive just to check. Say in your summary which ones you actually verified and which you took on trust.
- **Keep the frontmatter keys exactly as templated.** Three are read by hooks, not just by agents:
  - `stream` — which event stream this project writes to. Missing or renamed, telemetry silently goes to a directory named after the working directory.
  - `max_parallel_agents` — read by the tech lead as a hard cap on concurrently running agents. Missing means 3.
  - `merge_policy` — **enforced.** Anything other than `autonomous` blocks agents from completing a merge. Missing means gated, which is the safe failure.
  - `trunk_branch` — which branch the merge gate protects. Keep it in sync with the prose section; a wrong value means the gate protects the wrong branch.
- **The profile must be committed.** Agents read it from inside git worktrees by walking up from the working directory, so an uncommitted profile means each IC worktree falls back to defaults — splitting the event stream and, worse, leaving the merge gate reading a different policy than you set. Tell the user to commit it.
- **Prefer honest gaps over invention.** "No preview environments" is useful. A plausible-looking fabricated command is a trap.

## 5. Scaffold the directories

```sh
mkdir -p .claude/qa
cp -r "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/qa/." .claude/qa/
```

Don't overwrite an existing `.claude/qa/INDEX.md` or any accumulated plans or scripts — those are the project's own assets. (`agent-coach`'s reports directory is created by `team-ops` on first use; nothing to scaffold here.) On a refresh, add only what's missing.

Then make sure the project's `.gitignore` keeps the heavy and machine-local things out while keeping the assets in:

- `.claude/qa/runs/**` binary captures (the templated `runs/.gitignore` already handles this)
- nothing else needs ignoring — the event stream lives outside the repo, under `~/.claude/ops/<stream>/`

## 6. Browser automation, only if it applies

If and only if the project has a web surface, add a Playwright MCP server to the project's `.mcp.json` — **merging** into an existing file rather than replacing it:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--headless",
        "--ignore-https-errors",
        "--viewport-size", "1280x800",
        "--output-dir", ".claude/qa/runs/_artifacts"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Headless so long unattended runs don't steal focus; certificate errors ignored so self-signed dev certs don't block a run; output directed into the QA library so captures land where a run report can cite them. Mention that it needs one-time approval on first use, and that `@latest` is worth pinning if reproducible QA results across weeks matter.

For a project with no web surface, skip this entirely — don't make a SQL or CLI project launch a browser server every session.

## 7. Verify and hand off

```sh
# the merge gate matches the policy you just recorded
#   human-approval -> exit 2   |   autonomous -> exit 0
echo '{"agent_type":"engineering-team:tech-lead","tool_name":"Bash","cwd":"'"$PWD"'","tool_input":{"command":"gh pr merge 1"}}' | node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/merge-gate.mjs"; echo "exit=$?"

# ...and an IC keeping its branch current is never blocked (expect exit 0)
echo '{"agent_type":"engineering-team:ic-generalist","tool_name":"Bash","cwd":"'"$PWD"'","tool_input":{"command":"git merge origin/main"}}' | node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/merge-gate.mjs"; echo "exit=$?"
```

Run the merge-gate check and **say the result out loud to the user** — it's the one place where a typo in the profile silently changes how much autonomy the team has.

Then confirm telemetry resolves to the stream you just configured: invoke the `team-ops:log-friction` skill once with kind `tooling` and the note "init-team smoke test", and check the entry landed in `~/.claude/ops/<stream>/friction.jsonl`. If it landed in a directory named after the working directory instead, `stream:` in the profile isn't being read — check the frontmatter.

Then tell the user, briefly:

1. **What you detected and what you asked** — so they can spot a wrong inference.
2. **Which commands you verified by running** vs. took on trust.
3. **What to commit**: `.claude/team/project.md`, `.claude/team/knowledge.md`, the `.claude/qa/` scaffold, and `.mcp.json` if you touched it.
4. **The next step** — one concrete action, not a menu (see below). Mention that `agent-coach` is for later: after a week or a batch of tickets, since it needs traffic before its three-occurrence threshold means anything.
5. **The merge policy in plain words** — "agents will/won't merge without you, and here's how you'll be told" — plus the verified gate result.
6. **Anything you deliberately left blank** and what would fill it in.

Don't dump the generated file into the chat — say where it is and what's in it.

For the next step, name the actual work if the user mentioned any — a ticket key, or a design package that's ready for engineering. How you phrase it depends on where you're running — check before you write it:

- **You are the tech lead** — this session was started as `engineering-team:tech-lead`, so your own instructions describe that role. Don't tell the user to start a session; they're in it. Ask whether to go ahead — *"Setup's done. Shall I pick up ABC-123 now?"* — and on a yes, continue in this conversation.
- **You're in any other session** — give the exact command and a first message they can paste:

  ```
  claude --agent engineering-team:tech-lead
  > Pick up ABC-123
  ```
