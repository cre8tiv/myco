# engineering-team

A delivery agent team with two quality gates and an enforced human merge gate.

| Agent | Role | Isolation | Writes code? |
| ----- | ---- | --------- | ------------ |
| `tech-lead` | Decomposes goals, delegates, integrates, owns tracker truth | — | Only trivially |
| `ic-generalist` | Takes one scoped task end-to-end | git worktree | Yes |
| `ic-specialist-backend` | Same, with backend/schema/API defaults | git worktree | Yes |
| `code-reviewer` | Independent review of the diff | — | No (enforced) |
| `qa-specialist` | Test plans + execution against a running build | git worktree | Tests only |

Plus one skill, `/init-team`, which profiles the host project and writes the config the agents read.

Depends on [`team-ops`](../team-ops), installed automatically, which captures how the team works and provides `agent-coach` to analyze it.

## The contract with the host project

The agents ship **generic**. Everything project-specific lives in one file the host project owns:

```
.claude/team/project.md      <- tracker, field IDs, states, branch/PR conventions,
                                merge policy, automated PR reviewers,
                                build & run commands, verification commands,
                                environments, how QA exercises this software
```

Every agent reads it on dispatch. Agent definitions are installed plugin content that a plugin update overwrites, so nothing project-specific can live in them. `/init-team` generates the file; a human edits it thereafter.

`/init-team` also scaffolds the QA library the `qa-specialist` builds up over time:

```
.claude/qa/                  <- plans, scripts, fixtures, run evidence
```

## Starting from a design package

If the `design-team` plugin produced a package for the work, point the tech lead at it:

```sh
claude --agent engineering-team:tech-lead
> Implement phase 1 of docs/design/<slug>/
```

It reads the package index first, decomposes from the tech design's delivery slices, keeps requirement IDs in tickets, and carries security controls and UX states through as acceptance criteria. Design problems found during implementation are raised against the package — and logged, so the design team sees what its packages cost engineering.

## Tools and role boundaries

Agents don't pin a `tools:` list — a pinned list would have to name the host's tracker MCP tools, which differ per installation. Agents inherit the session's tools, and role boundaries are enforced where they matter:

- `code-reviewer` — `disallowedTools: Edit, Write, NotebookEdit`. It reviews; the IC fixes.

**The limit:** an agent with `Bash` can still write files through the shell. For `code-reviewer` the boundary is the frontmatter plus its instructions. Tighten further in project settings if your situation calls for it.

## Merge policy

`merge_policy` in the profile frontmatter, enforced by `scripts/merge-gate.mjs`:

- **`human-approval`** (the default, and what a missing profile resolves to) — no agent may complete a merge. `gh pr merge`, `az repos pr ... completed`, and a direct push to `trunk_branch` are blocked. The lead hands off instead: PR summary comment, review request to the named human, notification, ticket left in its review state.
- **`autonomous`** — agents may merge once every gate is green.

The gate keys on `agent_type`, so a human working in a plain session is never blocked — it gates autonomous merges, not the person who asked for one. It is deliberately narrow: `git merge origin/main` into a feature branch, pushing a feature branch, and opening a PR all stay allowed, because that is how an IC keeps its worktree current.

The gate covers `gh`, `az repos` and direct trunk pushes. It's a guardrail against forgetting, not a security boundary — an agent calling a hosting API another way isn't caught.

## Files

```

No `.mcp.json` ships with the plugin. `/init-team` adds a Playwright server to the host project's `.mcp.json` only when the project actually has a web surface — a SQL or CLI project shouldn't launch a browser server every session.
