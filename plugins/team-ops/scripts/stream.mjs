// Resolves which event stream a session belongs to, and where it lives on disk.
//
// The stream lives under the user's home directory, NOT in the project: ICs run in
// git worktrees, so a project-relative path would fragment the log into one stream
// per worktree and the analyst would only ever see a fraction of it.
//
// The name comes from `stream:` in the project profile, which is committed, so every
// worktree resolves the same name. Unconfigured projects fall back to the starting
// directory's name so two of them don't silently share one stream.
