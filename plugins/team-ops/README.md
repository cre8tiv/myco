# team-ops

Observability for agent teams. It captures how every installed team's agents actually work, gives those agents a way to report friction they hit, and provides `agent-coach`, which analyzes both and proposes changes to the teams' definitions and profiles.

You don't install it directly: `engineering-team` and `design-team` depend on it, so it's installed with either. It loads once however many teams depend on it.

| Component | What it does |
| --------- | ------------ |
| `agent-coach` agent | Periodic analysis across every team. Writes one dated report of evidence-backed proposals. Propose-only, enforced. |
| `log-friction` skill | Agents in any team call `team-ops:log-friction` to record process friction they can name. |
| `init-knowledge` skill | Records the docs, knowledge bases and other codebases every team should consult in `.claude/team/knowledge.md`. Run by `/init-design` and `/init-team`; run it directly to refresh. |
| `start-work` skill | Leads name the unit of work they're on — `<package>/round-<n>`, `<package>/phase-<n>`, a ticket — so cost can be attributed to it. The call is the record. |
| `cost-report` skill | What the work cost: per package and round, per ticket or phase, per agent, model or day. |
| Hooks | Capture tool failures, permission denials, subagent start/stop, compaction, task lifecycle and session ends — tagged by namespaced agent — and snapshot token usage. |

## What gets captured

**Hook events** — `PostToolUseFailure`, `PermissionDenied`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `PreCompact`, `TaskCreated`, `TaskCompleted`, `StopFailure`, `SessionEnd`. Every record carries the namespaced agent that produced it (`engineering-team:ic-generalist`, `design-team:architect`), so one stream covers every team. Only plugin agents are captured: plugins are installed per user, so the hooks fire in every session in the project, and a plain or orchestrating session's events aren't team activity. `SubagentStop` includes each agent's own final report. Successful tool calls are excluded; add `PostToolUse` to `hooks/hooks.json` temporarily for a full census.

**Friction self-reports** — logged by agents through the skill, with a kind: `instructions`, `tooling`, `permissions`, `scope`, `environment`, or `handoff`. The engineering tech lead logs every design problem it routes back to a design package as `handoff`; the design product lead logs specialist rework the same way. Those cross-team handoffs are the strongest signal the coach gets.

**One shape** — every record, hook event, friction report and usage snapshot alike, carries the same fields: the session, the full agent name (read from the subagent's own metadata, since hooks don't always name it), and the unit of work — the tag the lead set with `start-work`, or an agent's own `[TICKET]`. Friction reports pick these up from the session automatically. So friction, failures and cost join on the work they belong to.

**Where it lives** — `~/.claude/ops/<stream>/events.jsonl` and `friction.jsonl`, outside the repo, so every git worktree converges on one stream. The stream name is `stream:` in `.claude/team/project.md`, or in `.claude/team/design.md` if there's no `project.md`, looked up by walking up from the working directory. **The profile must be committed**, or each worktree falls back to its own directory name.

## Knowledge sources

`.claude/team/knowledge.md` is the one list, shared by every team, of the documentation and knowledge sources agents consult before inferring from the code or from memory: product docs, API references, internal engineering docs, knowledge graphs, runbooks. Each row says how to reach the source (an MCP server, a URL, or a repo path), **what questions it answers**, which roles use it, how authoritative it is, and whether it needs authorizing.

`/init-knowledge` builds it. It looks at every connected MCP server rather than a fixed list of types, so a server named after your product or an internal system gets found, and asks what each unrecognized one is for. It flags connectors that are configured but not authorized: authorization is per person, so each teammate authorizes once through claude.ai **Settings → Connectors** or `/mcp`.

A *Codebases* section lists the repositories the work touches beyond this one, each with a role: *system* (code this work changes, living elsewhere), *contract* (built against, not changed) or *reference* (prior art). Each is identified by its remote URL and ref, with an optional local path relative to the repository root. All of them are read-only to agents. Design packages record the commit each was grounded at.

*Authority* matters most to the design team: a capability documented in an *authoritative* source, such as the product's published docs, is something a design can build on as a supported contract; one found only in an *internal* source isn't.

## Cost

**What gets recorded.** When a team lead session ends, and when each team agent finishes, `scripts/usage.mjs` reads the session's transcripts — Claude Code keeps one per session and one per subagent, and every model response in them carries its token counts — and appends the totals per agent, unit of work and model to `~/.claude/ops/<stream>/usage.jsonl`. In a lead's session everything it spawned counts, built-in helpers like `Explore` included; elsewhere only team agents do.

**Attribution.** Leads invoke `team-ops:start-work` with a tag as they go — the product lead per decision round (`order-exceptions/round-2`), the tech lead per phase or ticket. The call lands in the transcript with a timestamp, and the lead's usage after it, and that of agents it starts, belongs to that tag. The tech lead also prefixes each agent's task description with its ticket (`[CLOUD-123] …`), so tickets within a phase are costed separately.

**Append-only, never overwritten.** Snapshots are cumulative per session and agent; the report reads only the latest of each, so a resumed session or a repeated hook supersedes rather than double-counts. A later round adds new records. Tokens are what's stored; dollars are computed at report time from `scripts/prices.json`, so correcting a price reprices history.

**Gaps it closes itself.** A headless run killed before its session ended never fires `SessionEnd`. The report re-reads any known session whose transcripts changed since its last snapshot, as long as Claude Code hasn't cleaned the transcripts up yet.

**How accurate.** Input and cache token counts match Claude Code's own accounting exactly; output tokens per response run somewhat lower than its session totals, so estimates tend to be a few percent to ~10% low. They're API list prices — a Team or Max subscription bills differently.

## Across a team

Set `TEAM_OPS_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and everything above is also exported as OpenTelemetry, to any backend that takes OTLP: cost as metrics, next to Claude Code's own, and hook events and friction as OTel events. Free text — friction notes, agent reports, errors — stays local unless you opt in. [`telemetry/README.md`](telemetry/README.md) documents the format, turning both exports on, choosing a backend when you have none, and an example Docker stack with a Grafana dashboard.

## Running the coach

Invoke `agent-coach` periodically — weekly, or after a batch of work — not per task. Its findings need three or more occurrences to count, so a report covering a couple of tasks is noise.

It writes `.claude/ops/reports/<date>-agent-health.md` in the fixed format from `templates/report-template.md`, and appends a row to `.claude/ops/reports/TRENDS.md`. Commit the reports: their history is how a later report tells whether an applied proposal actually moved anything.

**Propose-only, enforced.** `scripts/coach-guard.mjs` runs on `PreToolUse` and lets the coach write only into `.claude/ops/reports/` and scratch locations. It reads everything and argues for changes in the report; a human applies them. The guard fails open — an internal error never blocks legitimate work.

## Permission prompt on first friction log

The skill runs `node ".../team-ops/scripts/friction.mjs" ...`. The first time an agent logs friction in a session you'll be asked to approve that command. Approve it for the session, or run `/fewer-permission-prompts` to add it to the project allowlist.

## Troubleshooting

**The event stream is empty after real work.** Hooks load at session start — restart after installing. Check `node` is on PATH.

**Telemetry lands in a directory named after the project folder.** `stream:` can't be read from either profile. Check the key is present in the frontmatter and the profile is committed.

**Engineering and design activity are in two different streams.** `project.md` and `design.md` name different streams. Make them match — `project.md` wins when both exist.

**`agent-coach` says it can't write a file.** Working as designed. Its proposals are diffs inside the report.
