# Agent health — <window_start> to <window_end>

## Headline

Three bullets, maximum. What a reader gets if they read nothing else.

## Outcome signals

The quality baseline this window is measured against. Rates, not just counts.

| Signal | This window | Prior window | Direction |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Review: Request-changes rate | | | |
| QA: Fail rate | | | |
| Runs hitting compaction | | | |
| Tool-failure rate per subagent run | | | |

## Design and handoffs

Only if the design team had activity. Packages worked on this window, rounds to Ready,
decisions superseded, specialist documents sent back, and every design problem
engineering routed back to a package — with the package slug and the requirement,
control or ADR it concerned.

| Package | Status | Rounds | Superseded | Rework | Routed back from engineering |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| | | | | | |

## Friction by agent

| Agent | Runs | Tool failures | Perm. denials | Compactions | Self-reports |
| ----- | ---- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| | | | | | |

## Proposals

Ranked, at most five. Each needs all five parts or it belongs on the watch list.

### P1 — <one-line title>

- **Layer:** tooling | permissions | instructions | scope | environment | handoff
- **Evidence:** <counts over the window, plus one or two verbatim examples>
- **Diagnosis:** <cause, not symptom>
- **Expected effect:** <which signal should move>
- **How we'd know:** <metric and the window it should show up in>

## Watch list

Patterns with fewer than three occurrences. Carried forward, not acted on.

| Pattern | Occurrences | First seen | Note |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---- |

## Prior proposals — did they work?

| Report | Proposal | Applied? | Signal moved? |

## Blind spots this window

What the data could not tell you. Subagent internals are visible only through the
hook stream and self-reports, so name anything you inferred rather than observed.
